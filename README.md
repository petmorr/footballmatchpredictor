# Football Match Predictor

## Overview
The Football Match Predictor is a Python-based application designed to predict the outcomes of football matches using machine learning techniques. This project involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model development, and potentially front-end development for a web-based interface.

## Features
- Data collection from football statistics APIs or datasets.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.
- Machine Learning model to predict match outcomes.
- (Optional) Web interface for users to interact with the predictor.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- (Optional) Flask for web application
